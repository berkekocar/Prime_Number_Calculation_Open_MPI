# Prime_Number_Calculation_Open_MPI
I calculated the total prime number frequencies between 1 to 10000000 with Open MPI

  * In this task I calculated the total prime number summation between 1 to 10000000.
  * I have used the prime number calculation algorithm from the notes as a reference.
  * My development environment was MacOSX that I have installed OpenMP natively on my terminal.
  * For compiling and executing the program I used following commands:
  * Compiling: mpicc openmpi.c -o a.out                                          
  * Running: ./a.out;
